### Tasks

 1. Memory Game
 
    - You are presented with multiple images of celebrities. The images get shuffled every time they are clicked. User CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else the score resets to zero. 
    - If the user clicks different images each time, the score increments.
    - The user wins the game if the score equals the image count (it means the user always clicks a new image).

2. Current weather tracker

    - Use this source to get the data about weather api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=   {city name&appid={API key}
     - Here is API_KEY = d93da1ec68ba5770af2db5ad738e157c
     - Map some cities in the / page, then when user clicks on custom city redirect to /selected-city and then get the weather data using the upper endpoint.

3. Build a tag input using react
	
    - You can type on the input box and then press "Enter" key on your keyboard to create a tag.
    - Every tag has a button ('X') to remove itself.
    - make your work look good. 
    - Tags should not be repeated

4. Color Picker In React
	
    - You need to have four sliders (or inputs) to control four parameters of the color: red, green, blue and alpha.
    - Once you change the sliders (or inputs), you can see the background color changing based on the current parameters.
    - You don't have to follow the UI in the example, but make your work look good.
